This repository contains all code files for my Bachelor thesis titled: 
"Exploring Named Entity Recognition and Sentiment Analysis for Brand Reputation Management Using Pretrained Neural Networks"

All files for model development (NER_Llama, SA_Llama, NER_BERT, SA_BERT) can only be run in a timely manner with GPU-hardware.

The corpora used for final fine-tuning are compiled in the "data collection"-file.
Every dataset used can be downloaded via the link provided in the respective section of the "data collection"-notebook.
